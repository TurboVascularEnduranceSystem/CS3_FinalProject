Around the 1800s to 1900s, a group of Jewish immigrants fled to Palestine (which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire), which had a Christian- and Arab-dominant population. After World War I, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the British, under the Balfour Declaration, supported a Jewish homeland. This sparked tensions between Arab and Jewish communities. Then, after World War II, since many Jews were displaced from their homeland due to the Holocaust, the United Nations proposed to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish homelands. The Jewish leaders agreed to the proposition, while the Arab leaders did not. On May 14, 1948, Israel declared its independence. Because of this, neighboring Arab states declared war on Israel. This conflict was called the Arab-Israeli War, during which more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled in an event called the Nakba, which means “catastrophe.” In 1967, the Six-Day War occurred, with Israel responding to the Egyptian and Syrian mobilization for war. Israel managed to capture the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.

    The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was established as the official representative of the Palestinian people and fought Israel through uprisings and conflicts. Later, groups emerged from this, an example being Hamas. Since 2006, both parties have been at odds with each other. In recent years, many atrocities have been committed, such as the bombing of civilian towns, the murder of both women and children, the use of human shields, and many other acts of violence. In 2025, Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire, but it was broken after Hamas started firing rockets at Israeli citizens. Many more ceasefires were agreed upon but were inevitably broken. As of September 2025, the conflict between Israel and Palestine has continued.
